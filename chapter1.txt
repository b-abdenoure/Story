As iOS developer I wanna try to make some project for my portfolio, that can be a small apps with one features or two, I can also do bigger project as e-commerce app, delivery app, productivity app, enterprise app with some network data capability with restful api or at least classic google sheet to fetch and push data as database for, the idea to use a google sheet is basic but that can respond to some usage and make me be familiar with, also I can generate an history user or updating delevry cart to the service personal who can use a professional version of the app.
